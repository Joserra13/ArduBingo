# ArduBingo

The **Ardubingo Project** takes the classic game of bingo and gives it a techy twist, turning it into a fun and hands-on way to learn electronics and coding. It’s all about capturing the same excitement of shouting “bingo!” but with the added thrill of creating something awesome along the way.
